Rummy 500 Score Keeper
(Inspired and rooted in the Score Keeper App project in Udacity's Android Basics nanodegree program.

I grew up with my family playing Rummy 500, and I was taught by them.
Playing this game is one of my favorite ways to spend time with them. I'm hoping to impress them with this mobile app I created with them in mind.
